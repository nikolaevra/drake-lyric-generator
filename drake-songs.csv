the-calm,so-far-gone,"Uh, I'm just so far gone, october's own, Please leave me alone Drunk off champagne screamin' in the phone See my house is not a home, fuck is goin' on Where did we go wrong, where do we belong Caught up in the game and it's one I can't postpone Meaning if it rains I'm the one it's raining on When my diamond chain is on still nothing set in stone Women borrow sweaters that I spray with my cologne And tell me don't forget 'em and I promise that I won't Feelin' so distant from everyone I've known To make everybody happy I think I would need a clone Places we get flown, parties that we've thrown I've done more for this city then these rappers that have blown It's only been 3 Years look at how I've grown I'm just in my zone, I call this shit the calm Yea, but I'm the furthest thing from calm Dedicated to my mom, and I swear my word is bond Everything will be ok and it won't even take that long You can see it in my face or even read it on my palm Leader of the new school it's proven and it's known I'm sittin' in a chair but in the future it's a throne I know you like to worry it'll be better if you don't cause...You know, everything gone be alright, I promise. A Pologize to you know, to put ya'll in this position and vent to ya'll but... 40 mom always say, ""Don't ask permisson, just ask forgiveness"" You know, so... forgive me.Uh, And life is so insane, look what I've became, tryna make a name All my first dates are interrupted by my fame Because every picture taken is a fan that you can gain They love it when you smile unaware that it's a strain It's a curse you gotta live with when you born to entertain Women need attention and fore women will complain Develop hatred for men and say that your the one to blame Tryna enjoy myself with Taz in miami at the game I just wish he knew how much it really weighed like dwayne It's a weight that's on my chest whoever spottin' me is playin' So I'm liftin' all alone try not to get a sprain Hopin' western union doing currency exchange Cause my dad called and got me feelin' guilty and ashamed Like, how I had a Rolls and I went and got a Range And he payin' for his cigarettes with dollars and some change Damn, and I could only feel his pain Cause in memphis tennessee there's only so much to attain So I'm fillin' out the form at the counter once a-gain He say he love me I just hope he doesn't say that shit in vain I'm why ya girl heart is in a slang Call me heartbreak Drake I'm the hardest one to tame As a man I'm just honest as a artist I'm a king With my own set of problems that be sittin' on my brain Yea, And see this is the thang What they viewing as braggin' is the way that I maintain The shit I write while staring out the window of a plane Is the single handed reason I Remain...Me, Yea... Uh, I said I call this shit the calm. But I'm the furthest thing from calm. I swear I'm puttin' on but they always wanna ask what type of act you puttin' on like... Man."
fear,so-far-gone,"This is why I do this shit I think they call this, ventingLook, This is me, still the same They want the hits, I play the game No auto-tune, but you can feel the pain It all comes spilling out like I hit a vein What up, Lil' Bruh? What up, Slum Ville? I hope you know that y'all the reason I have fun still The fans thinking that we all signed for mil Equal opportunity rappin', that shit is unreal That ain't how it works, that ain't how it goes And I been gettin' high just to balance out the lows And I could use a writer just to balance out my flows But I never share my thoughts this is all a nigga knows And everytime I try, it opens up my eyes These verses are a chance to be remembered and reprised And I will be performin' this as long as I'm alive So every word I utter will be mine: Don't believe the lies. Look me in my eyes Please don't be scared of me. Please don't be scared of me. I remember you.This feeling isn't new.So please don't be scared of me. Please don't be scared of me. Oh oh oh oh oh yeah I never cried when Pac died But I probably will when Hov does And if tears hold value Then I will drop one for every single thing he showed usAnd I'll be standing in a puddle. I stay away from niggas that could land me in some troubleAnd I'mma keep it honest, I'm so tired of being subtle It's just me, Forty, O and Neek standing in a huddle Staring at the members of my team Who get questioned about they profit From this million dollar scheme Just know that I'm in debt for you defending all our dreams I hope you tell your family this shit ain't what it seems But y'all the reason for a lot of my devotion. You know I spend money because spending time is hopeless And know I pop bottles cuz i bottle my emotions. At least I put it all in the open: Dont believe the lies. Look me in my eyes. Please don't be scared of me.Please don't be scared of me. I remember you. This feeling isnt new.So please don't be scared of me. Please don't be scared of me. oh oh oh oh oh yeah Look. Fuck all y'all, we ignore feelings herePremature millionaires Welcome to my realest year. Yeah, I swear that we making a killing here I should be on top of the world just chillin' hereBut it's funny having fans Who find you before anybody ever has the chance And build you up, so you could be the biggest in the game And realize when you're there sometimes the shit don't feel the same Yeah, and plus things are just surreal at home People think I've changed just cause my appeal has grown And now security follows me everywhere So I never actually am alone, I just always feel alone I think I'm scared of what the future holds I was wishing for some things and now am used to those. Every girl I meet thinks im fucking groupie hoes. The honesty of my music has left me too exposed. All my old friends think i got a new crowd. And people seem to notice every time I do smile. I guess that mean they come few and far between. Even though I'm living out what you would call the dream. Yeah. And my uncle aint even messaging me. And him missing in my life is kind of messing with me. I hope this isnt one of those forever things. Its funny how money can change everything.: Dont believe the lies. Look me in my eyes. Please dont be scared of me. Please dont be scared of me. I remember you. This feeling isnt new. So please dont be scared of me. Please dont be scared of me."
